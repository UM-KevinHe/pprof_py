class SummaryMixin(ABC):
    """Mixin for generating summary statistics for a fitted model.

    This mixin provides an abstract interface for producing detailed model summaries,
    including coefficients, standard errors, and confidence intervals. It can be integrated
    with any statistical model that supports summary reporting.

    Subclasses should implement the `summary` method to return a model-specific summary
    object or representation.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> class MyModel(SummaryMixin):

        Parameters
        ----------
