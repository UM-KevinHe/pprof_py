# STATUS — pprof_py presentation layer

**Updated:** 2026-10-01 · **Branch:** `test/plotting` (base `d3d92a1` = `v0.5.0`) · **Home:** `pprof_py/docs/design/presentation/` (unpublished, not packaged)

## Phase
3 (MVP) in progress under decisions D9–D22. Rounds apply in strict order; each is one self-contained diff.

| Round | Content | State |
|---|---|---|
| R1 | Test workflow (3.10/3.14), Python ≥ 3.10, numba ≥ 0.57, docs workflow on 3.10 + Node 24 actions, changelog, design docs | delivered |
| R1b (optional) | One-line pandas-1.5 fix in `test_sigma_sensitivity` | delivered; needs approval (test change); later rounds do not depend on it |
| R2 | `pprof_py.presentation`: `Theme`, `formatting`, accessibility metrics; layering tests; lazy pyplot imports in `plotting/` | delivered |
| R3 | `funnel_limits` (function + model methods), zero-event status, excluded-provider records, CoxPH metadata | next |
| R4–R8 | presentation data; funnel; interval plot; tables (+ `excel` extra); delegates, deprecations, acceptance | pending |

## R2 evidence
- Legacy outputs bit-identical to `v0.5.0`: 27 of 27 hashes (21 plot calls across four model families, `plot_caterpillar`, four `test()` outputs).
- `import pprof_py`: 1.52–1.54 s with pyplot → 1.14–1.20 s, loading neither pyplot nor Matplotlib.
- 40 new tests (formatting, theme, accessibility, layering). Layering negative control: planted violations fail 4 of 5 tests.
- Accessibility metrics vendored (Machado 2009 matrices reproduce colorspacious to 1e-16); thresholds in ADR-008.

## σ-sensitivity verification (D16)
On the Python 3.10 floor stack (numpy 1.23.0, pandas 1.5.0, scipy 1.9.0, statsmodels 0.13.1, numba 0.57.0) the stage-3 refits at both ends of the σ interval genuinely differ, identically to the latest stack: σ interval 0.189 / 0.319 / 0.567; 4 of 40 providers change flag across it. The test fails there only because its last line calls `DataFrame.to_numpy(float)` on a frame with a nullable `Int64` column containing NA, which pandas 1.5 rejects (`ValueError`); newer pandas maps NA to NaN. R1b passes `na_value=np.nan`.

## Reported, not fixed
- `dev` extra: `statsmodels>=0.13` cannot be installed from wheels on Python 3.10 (0.13.0 has no 3.10 wheel; its source build fails); 0.13.1 is the lowest installable. Raise it before adding a minimum-version job.
- Minimum-version job (D16): the floor stack passes everything except `test_setup_logger` (no tzdata in this container) and the R1b test.
- Statistical-layer observations from audit §9.

## Next step
R3: `pprof_py.inference.funnel_limits` and model methods (count, score, Wald and CoxPH tests; half-integer limits; per-provider marks for Poisson-binomial nulls), zero-event status across families, excluded-provider records from `DataPrep`, CoxPH `measure`/`reference` metadata, with S4 invariant tests and negative controls.
